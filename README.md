# Eaglercraft Beta Server For Replit
A server script for Eaglercraft Beta that runs on Nix and Java.
NOTE: please keep the README.md file inside this repl so I (Tiega91/Github) can get proper credit, its all I ask for. EDIT 12/12/22: Please note that due to how eaglercraft beta works this is only a localhost server, meaning only people on your local network/signed into your replit account can use this.
# HOW TO SETUP ON REPLIT
1. Fork this
2. Go to replit
3. Create a new repl
4. Press import from github
5. Import your server
6. This part isnt needed, but if you wish configure the server to your liking
7. Run the server. NOTE: this wont run a replit website, so access this from a eaglercraft beta site. if it says 403/503 Forbidden or something else, it means the server is online and running.
